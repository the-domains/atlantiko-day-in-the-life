  you come across these strange creatures and wonder what on earth you are
  coming face to face with and then think how come i have never seen them
  before, let alone wondered what they might taste like... Percebes, or a type
  of barnacle - but not any old molusc, rather the salty sweet and divine
  tasting delight from the Cantabrian Sea... hello you little beauties... daddy
  is here :)
